#// PSK; //PHP Class Library

PSK is a web applicatiom development framework for php. It's main features;

* Designed through MVC aproach.
* Supports event driven programming.
* It makes easy to handle database access, session management, authentication and authorization and so on...
* Allows you to build interactive user interfaces with controls (or componenets or widgets).
* ...

PSK is a hobby project. So don't compare it with other prfessional libraries. If you need some think secure, some think powerfull, some think complete, you can look at Zend Framework, Symfony, CodeIgniter or any other. I don't recommend you to use PSK for your real world applications.

You can see class hierarchy diagram as below;
